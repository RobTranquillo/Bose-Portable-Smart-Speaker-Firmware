List of Firmware downloads for the [Portable Bose Portable Smart Speaker](https://www.bose.com/p/speakers/bose-portable-smart-speaker/PORTSS-SPEAKERWIRELESS.html)

I am very interested in getting all the old firmware versions. Since my device no longer connects to the Google Assistant, but it worked before with older versions.

Please contact me if you have official download links to old firmware versions!

My last installed firmware is:
20.011.1633 Jenkins@auto-nucleus-bdsp-pod-adaws-xrj6x
downloaded via:  https://worldwide.bose.com/support/PHSFW wich redirects to https://ota.cdn.bose.io/taylor/product_update.zip
I get this download from my GERMAN ([www.bose.de](https://www.bose.de/de_de/myaccount/dashboard.html)) product download page.

It contains among others:
Bose GoogleVoiceAssistant Package version 3.1.11+gfb467d6
Bose GoogleCast Package version 0.0.331+g537808a


Please have a look at https://github.com/bosefirmware for much more other Bose firmwares.
